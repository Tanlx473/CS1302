    "# Week 8 Lecture Note: Composite Data Type(Lists and Tuples)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation of Composite Data Type | 复合数据类型的动机\n",
    "- When calculating the average of a small number of values, a simple function can be used. However, when dealing with a large amount of data like the average household income in Hong Kong (with a labor size close to 4 million), a composite data type is needed to store variable-sized data sequences.  \n",
    "  计算少量数据的平均值时，可以使用简单函数。然而，对于处理大量数据（如香港的平均家庭收入，劳动力规模接近 400 万），需要使用复合数据类型来存储可变大小的数据序列。\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python has four collection data types: \n",
    "  - **List (列表)**: Ordered and mutable, allowing duplicates | 有序且可变，允许重复元素。\n",
    "  - **Tuple (元组)**: Ordered and immutable, allowing duplicates | 有序且不可变，允许重复元素。\n",
    "  - **Set (集合)**: Unordered and unindexed, no duplicates | 无序且无索引，不允许重复元素。\n",
    "  - **Dictionary (字典)**: Unordered, mutable, and indexed, no duplicates | 无序、可变且有索引，不允许重复键。\n",
    "  (This lecture focuses on Lists and Tuples. | 本次讲座重点介绍列表和元组。)"

    "2. **Constructing Sequences**\n",
    "    - **By Enumeration**:\n",
    "        - Tuples are created by enclosing a comma - separated sequence in parentheses. For single - element tuples, a comma is required after the element. For example, `(0,)` is a tuple, while `(0)` is just the number 0. The unpacking operator `*` can be used to unpack iterables in tuple construction.\n",
    "        - Lists are created by enclosing a comma - separated sequence in square brackets. For example, `[0]` is a list.\n",
    "    - **By Comprehension**:\n",
    "        - Comprehension is an efficient way to create lists and tuples based on existing iterables. It consists of an output expression, iteration, and optional conditional filtering. The syntax for list comprehension is `[output_expression for item in iterable if conditional_filtering]`.\n",
    "        - For example, `[i + j for i in range(1, 10) for j in range(1, 5)]` generates a list of sums. To create a tuple using comprehension, the `tuple()` constructor is needed, like `tuple(x**2 for x in range(10))`."

    "3. **Selecting Items in a Sequence**\n",
    "    - **Traversal**:\n",
    "        - For loops can be used to iterate over tuples and lists in order. The `reversed()` function can be used to iterate in reverse. The `zip()` function allows simultaneous traversal of multiple sequences, and the length of the new iterator is determined by the shortest input sequence.\n",
    "    - **Indexing**:\n",
    "        - Positive indices start from 0, and negative indices represent offsets from the end of the sequence. Accessing elements beyond the valid index range raises an `IndexError`.\n",
    "    - **Slicing**:\n",
    "        - Slicing is used to select a range of items with the syntax `a[start:stop:step]`. The `start` defaults to 0, `stop` defaults to the length of the sequence, and `step` defaults to 1 if not specified. Negative values can be used for these parameters.\n",
    "    - **Sorting**:\n",
    "        - The `quicksort` algorithm can be implemented to sort a sequence. There is also a built - in `sorted()` function in Python that uses the Timsort algorithm and is more efficient.\n",
    "4. **Mutation and Aliasing**\n",
    "    - **Mutation**:\n",
    "        - Mutable objects like lists can be changed after creation. When a variable of a mutable data type is assigned to another variable, changes to the data are reflected in both variables. For example, if `x = ['hi']` and `y = x`, then `y += ['bye']` will also change `x`.\n",
    "        - Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable. For lists, subscription and slicing can be used as assignment targets to mutate the list, but there are size - matching restrictions for extended slices.\n",
    "    - **Aliasing**:\n",
    "        - Aliasing occurs when one variable is assigned to another variable of a mutable data type. In this case, the two variables refer to the same object. For example, if `a = [10, 20, 30, 40]` and `b = a`, then `a is b` and `a == b` are both `True`."

    "5. **Different Methods to Operate on a Sequence**\n",
    "    - **Membership Check**:\n",
    "        - The `in` and `not in` operators are used to check if an element is in a tuple or list. They call the `__contains__` method.\n",
    "    - **Common Attributes**:\n",
    "        - Both tuples and lists have `count` (returns the number of occurrences of a value) and `index` (returns the index of the first occurrence of a value) methods.\n",
    "    - **List - Specific Attributes**:\n",
    "        - Lists have methods like `append`, `clear`, `copy`, `extend`, `insert`, `pop`, `remove`, `reverse`, and `sort`. Most of these methods mutate the list, except `copy`.\n",
    "    - **Tuple - Specific Attributes**:\n",
    "        - Tuples have no public - specific attributes. A tuple can be copied using slicing, e.g., `b = a[::-1]` creates a reversed copy of tuple `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this lecture covered the creation, access, mutation, and operation methods of tuples and lists in Python, which are important composite data types for handling data sequences. "
